My name is Kamil and I'm a software developer living in Warsaw, Poland.

I love making software and I want to be as good in it as I can.

In this blog I'll share with you my experience, write about cool technologies and probably rant about what pisses me off in IT world from time to time.

First and foremost, I want you to find some value in my posts.

If you find something interesting here, don't hesitate to give me a shout - it would mean world to me!
