# Let me introduce you to Shyshka! #

I'm participating in ["Daj sie poznaÄ‡"](http://devstyle.pl/daj-sie-poznac/) contest and one of requirements is to create open source project and to blog about it at least once a week (you need to publish 2 posts a week - one project related and the second can be about broadly defined IT).

## What? ##

My project is called [Shishka](https://github.com/detfis/shyshka) - it's an online personal dictionary. This is an open source project and it can be found on github [here](https://github.com/detfis/shyshka).

## Why? ##

Out of personal need - I'm doing my best to master English and one of the best advices I got was to start _hunting_ for words and interesting phrases. 

Whenever I heard something interesting - I wrote it down, whenever I wanted to say something and didn't know how - I made note out of it.
Learning English became very fun - whenever I watched TV, read something in English or just spoke with someone in that language I kept my ears open to catch new phrases or unknown sentences. 

Firstly, I went old school - I was writing them down in a notebook. It  had worked for me at the beginning, until my dictionary grew. I wasn't able to find sentences I had saved previously nor edit any of them. I needed something more advanced. 

I had a couple of requirements:
* it has to be accessible online
* adding new words and phrases has to be as easy as possible
* I need the ability to search through my dictionary

After a small research I found out that there is nothing that meets my requirements. This is when the idea of project [Shishka](https://github.com/detfis/shyshka) was born. 

## How? ##

[Shyshka](https://github.com/detfis/shyshka) will be a simple web app to store sentences, translations and examples of uses. 

I want to take this opportunity to learn a new web framework, called [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/). 

I'm a big [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) enthusiast, but I'm not so fond of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), which is the most popular web framework in the [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) world. 

[Hanami](http://hanamirb.org/) is not in the mainstream yet, but it tries to address the problems where [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is not so great:
* it's lightweight
* it supports good software engineering practices 
* and it's threadsafe. 

I will write more about this awesome framework in one of the future posts.
